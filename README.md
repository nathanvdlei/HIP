# HIP
### Background:
This project presents the Highway Inspection Planning (HIP) prototype. The main idea here is to be able to use the publically available accidents dataset called BRON to assess the likelihood a specific accident caused damage to the Dutch highway system. This information can then be used to optimize inspection plannings for maintenance contractors.

This repository was developed for the Knowledge Engineering course (2020-2021) at the Vrije Universitieit (VU) in Amsterdam.


### How to use:
Step 1: To use the application download a accident dataset yourself from the BRON database:
    https://data.overheid.nl/dataset/9841-verkeersongevallen---bestand-geregistreerde-ongevallen-nederland

Step 2: Download the HIP project to your local machine

Step 3: Open the DEMO Jupyter Notebook to interact with the data

Step 4: Change the file location of the dataset to your local copy of the database from step 1.

Step 5: You can interact with the knowledge based HIP system using the DEMO notebook
